# Stanford CS229 â€” Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of core CS229 machine learning algorithms, organized by category.

## Structure

- **Linear Models**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Perceptron
  - Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)
- **Probabilistic Models**
  - Naive Bayes
- **Clustering**
  - K-Means on Iris Dataset
  - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) from Scratch
- **Dimensionality Reduction**
  - Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
- **Neural Networks**
  - Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) on CIFAR-10
- **Support Vector Machines**
  - Kernel Trick on SVM

## Notes

- Each folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and supporting files (PDF writeups, README, etc).
- Implementations are written from scratch for learning purposes.
- No external ML libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, TensorFlow) are used unless explicitly noted.
